# Sample Python Calculator

This repository contains a simple command-line calculator implemented in Python.

## Requirements

Python 3.x is required.

## Usage

Run the script with one of the supported commands:

```bash
python calculator.py add 1 2        # Outputs 3
python calculator.py subtract 5 3   # Outputs 2
python calculator.py multiply 2 4   # Outputs 8
python calculator.py divide 10 2    # Outputs 5
python calculator.py power 2 3      # Outputs 8
```

The calculator supports five basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Division by zero results in an error.
